                        <p>"Hello, my name is Karl Marro Eslava, and I reside in Dasmarinas, Cavite. 
                            I graduated from the Technological University of the Philippines, 
                            Cavite Campus, with a Bachelor's degree in Power Plant Engineering. 
                            My passion lies in exploring and embracing the latest technological advancements, 
                            which drives me to continuously learn and grow. I aspire to be part of the IT industry, 
                            where I can apply my skills and knowledge. I am eager to adapt to new challenges and responsibilities, 
                            and I am confident that this journey will bring me personal and professional fulfillment."</p>

                            "In my free time, I nurture my creativity through various forms of artistic expression. 
                            I enjoy creating digital art with software, as well as traditional art with pen and paper,
                             which helps me develop my adaptability and imagination. 
                             Gaming is another one of my passions, particularly card dueling, puzzles, 
                             and city management, as it allows me to relax and challenge my critical thinking skills. 
                             Ultimately, I'm always seeking out new knowledge and skills to apply in real-life 
                             scenarios, driving my continuous growth and development."</p>
